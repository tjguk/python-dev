python-make
===========

Build Python on Windows using command-line versions of Visual Studio

(NB this leans heavily on the work which Zach Ware has done under
http://bugs.python.org/issue16895. This isn't a clone of that, but I've
made use of all the work he's done there and elsewhere within the Python
build system on Windows, so many thanks to him).
